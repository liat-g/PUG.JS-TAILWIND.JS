                | you seperate the html tag on a newline with a | since pug recognizes 
                | a newline as a new html tag
                div.col-sm-6.offset-2.p-3.border.bg-light.justify-content-center here is another column offset by 2
                    div.p-3.border.bg-light.justify-content-center you can use inline attributes and nested tags
        h1.p-3.justify-content-center  i am using pug to generate my html 
        p.p-3 here is a list of internal conflicts that you can write in line pug js with "each item"
